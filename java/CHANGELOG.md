## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- First release of the Java implementation. It includes:
  - An attestation endpoint that tells anyone holding an attestation key, without signing in, whether the key is
    registered and whether its relationship is active, revoked or expired.
  - A self-service page where members sign in through the organisation's own sign-in system, over OpenID Connect or
    SAML, to register their keys.
  - A public manifest describing the organisation, in each language it offers.
  - Support for PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQL Server, with relationships granted from the organisation's own systems.
  - Pages in 57 languages, in light and dark, built to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA.
