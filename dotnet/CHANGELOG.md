# Changelog (.NET)

All notable changes to the .NET implementation of the Astrana Trusted Attestation Server are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). The first two numbers of a version are shared by the .NET,
Java and PHP implementations, and the last number moves on its own for a fix to one implementation.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- First release of the .NET implementation. It includes:
  - An attestation endpoint that tells anyone holding an attestation key, without signing in, whether the key is
    registered and whether its relationship is active, revoked or expired.
  - A self-service page where members sign in through the organisation's own sign-in system, over OpenID Connect or
    SAML, to register their keys.
  - A public manifest describing the organisation, in each language it offers.
  - Support for PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQL Server, with relationships granted from the organisation's own systems.
  - Pages in 57 languages, in light and dark, built to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA.
